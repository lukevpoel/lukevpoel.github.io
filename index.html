The event page lists all relevant information for the event, as well as a map view to visualize where the event is at. </p> <h3>What I learned</h3> <p>The main objective of this project was to learn how to adapt my skills to solve new problems.

The app would use the input to retrieve and display data based on the openweathermap API.</p> <h3>What I learned</h3> <p>I learned how to accept input from users, and use an API to retrieve data. I learned how to consume that data, and use it to display useful information to my user. Additionally I learned to leverage a user's local storage to enable them to easily return to previous searches.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row zen-div"> <div class="textbox col-4"> <h2><a href="http://www.lvpoel.me/wats1010-css-zen-garden/">CSS Zen Garden - </a><a href=https://github.com/lukevpoel/volleyball-final>The Code</a></h2> <h3>The purpose</h3> <p>This is a standard for web developers beginning to show their grasp on CSS.

The goal was to gain an understanding of how to use tools like Google Analytics. Understanding why analytics tools are important, and how to make use of some of the data that they provide.</p> <h3>The work</h3> <p>NThis project consisted of implementing Analytics into a few sites. After collecting that data I analyzed it and explained it in the journal.</p> <h3>What I learned</h3> <p>There were a few key things that I learned. It took some trial and error to correcty use Google Analytics. Especially to ensure that it was collecting all the data I wanted. Google Analytics is a powerful tool that puts a lot of information at your fingertips. I also learned how to navigate around Analytics, and then be able to analyze the data.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row flickr-div"> <div class="textbox col-4"> <h2><a href="http://www.lvpoel.me/wats1020-flickr-search/">Flickr App - </a><a href=https://github.com/lukevpoel/wats1020-flickr-search>The Code</a></h2> <h3>The purpose</h3> <p>The purpose of building this website was to learn how to request data from a service using an API</p> <h3>The work</h3> <p>Using flickr, I built a very simple website.
